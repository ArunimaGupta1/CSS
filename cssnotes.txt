used to style the web page is easier way
HTML tags are used to create web page
attributes are used to add some effects, some additional features
If same attribute value i need to apply for multiple HTML tags i will have to repeat the same
so CSS will ease down this operation

what css can do?
    control 
        color of text
        style of font
        how columns will be spacing and width in a table

        many times the HTML tag will not have a specific attribute. that operation we can control through CSS

   
for applying CSS
1. selector - the HTML tag where the style needs to be applied
2. property - the attribute for which you want to set the value
3. value    - the value to be set for the property

selector{
    property : value
}

example:
h1 {
     color: red;
   }

table{
    border : 3px;
}   

when we need to apply any style we need to select the HTML tag
to select the HTML tag we will use selector
1. type selector
2. id selector
3. class selector
4. multiple selector
5. universal selector
6. descendant selector
7. child selector
8. attribute selector

how to add style?
we will create html page and add CSS to it
3 levels
    1. inline
    2. internal
    3. external  

cascading order:
1. inline style : first preference    
2. internal style
3. external style
4. browser default
